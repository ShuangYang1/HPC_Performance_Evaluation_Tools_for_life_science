Bismark report for: dataset/Bismark/SRR020138.fastq (version: v0.24.2)
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequences analysed in total:	15034315
Number of alignments with a unique best hit from the different alignments:	5061470
Mapping efficiency:	33.7%
Sequences with no alignments under any condition:	9582649
Sequences did not map uniquely:	390196
Sequences which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequences with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/CT:	2532955	((converted) top strand)
CT/GA:	2528515	((converted) bottom strand)
GA/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
